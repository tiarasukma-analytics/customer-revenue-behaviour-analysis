# Customer Behaviour Analysis — Superstore (Python)

## Overview
This project analyzes customer revenue behavior using transactional sales data, with a focus on time-based revenue retention.

## Objectives
- Analyze revenue retention over time using cohort analysis
- Assess revenue concentration across customers
- Apply Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for analytical workflows

## Dataset
- Source: Superstore Sales (Kaggle)
- Format: Event-level logs

## Key Findings
- Revenue retention varies across cohorts with irregular patterns over time.
- Revenue dependency is distributed rather than dominated by a small number of customers.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Time-based cohort revenue retention
- Customer-level revenue concentration analysis

## Limitations
- No quantity data available
- Missing order dates reduced sample size
- Analysis reflects historical behavior only

## Tools
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
